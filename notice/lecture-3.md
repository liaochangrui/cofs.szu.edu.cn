报告题目：Photonic Technologies at Aston University – Advanced fibre grating devices and applications

主持人：王义平 教授

报告人简介：Prof Lin Zhang (Ph.D) is the Head of the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Power Engineering and the Deputy Director of AIPT at Aston University. Her research interests are primarily in the field of optical fibre grating devices and applications in optical communications, signal processing, biophotonics, fibre lasers and smart sensing. Her research output so far includes ~400 research papers published in peer-review journals and international conferences.

报告摘要：The talk will give an overview of the research activities of the AIPT with the emphasis on fabrication techniques and sensing applications of advanced optical fibre grating devices created in normal and special optical fibres by UV- and femtosecond-laser inscription. A range of novel optical fibre grating devices and systems based on Bragg, long-period and tilted structures fabricated in D-shape, multi-mode and multi-core fibres will be discussed. The most recent developments in tilted grating based novel polarisation devices and their function in fibre laser systems will be reviewed.
